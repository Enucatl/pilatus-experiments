<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-10">
        <p>The pilatus detector is now directly in front of the collimator
            slit, which can be seen around pixel 105.</p>

        <p>The detector is slightly misaligned with respect to the slit.</p>

        <p>Some paper under the right hand side of the detector puts it
            right on pixel 105.</p>

        <p class="alert alert-danger">not that the holder is unstable and
            the alignment needs to be checked periodically.</p>
