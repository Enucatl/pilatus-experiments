        The source is a Comet MXR 160/HP-11 tube operated at 160 kVp and 10 mA. Used for grating interferometry with 120 keV,
        100 keV and 60 keV design energy. The experiments presented today
        were realized with a 120 keV, 3rd Talbot order setup.

        The gratings need to be very thick to block the radiation with an
        energy up to 160 keV, and a small period is necessary to achieve
        high sensitivity of the interferometer. This makes a 2D grating not
        feasible with the current microfabrication technology. Therefore, we
        illuminate the gratings from the edge, so that the light travels
        through the long side of the grating. A high aspect ratio is
        achieved at the cost of the vertical spatial dimension.
